- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ocampo-s
 
I am currently transitioning into the IT world. In my previous line of work, I have worked as a language teacher (Spanish, English) and as a project worker.
I have been professionally involved in the public sector with matters of immigration, civic integration, and mental health. These projectsâ€™ commonality is the central role that communication plays in their development and use of new technologies.

My academic background has prepared me very well for critical thinking and problem solving as well as being systematic and methodical in seeking solutions to an unknown issue.

I am looking forward to new experiences.
